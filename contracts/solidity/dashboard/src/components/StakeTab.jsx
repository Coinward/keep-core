          Keep network does not require token owners to perform the day-to-day operations of staking
          with the private keys holding the tokens. This is achieved by stake delegation, where different
          addresses hold different responsibilities and cold storage is supported to the highest extent practicable.

          Simplified arrangement where you operate and receive rewards under one account.
