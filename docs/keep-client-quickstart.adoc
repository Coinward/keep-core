= Keep Client Quickstart

:icons: font
:numbered:
toc::[]

Here we provide a short description of material and steps required to run the keep-client.

The deployment bundle referenced in this document will be sent separately.

== The Parts

The deployment bundle contains five items:

1. keep-client Docker image
2. keep-client configuration file
3. Ethereum account keyfile
4. Text file with Ethereum account password
5. This document

== Networking

The application needs ingress/egress access on port `3919`.

The ingress port is configurable and can be set in the included `keep-client-config.toml` file.

`Port` is in section `[libp2p]`.

== Starting The Client

*Depending on how you orchestrate containers, these steps will vary.  Here we illustrate
from the perspective of the Docker client.*

*The keep-client configuration file is already prepared, should you want to change the file paths
feel free.  This guide will assume you use the default paths.*

=== Unzip the bundle

```
mkdir keep-client-deployment-bundle
tar -xvf keep-client-deployment-bundle.tar.gz -C keep-client-deployment-bundle
```

Resulting directory should look like:

```
.
├── keep-client-deployment-bundle
│   ├── config
│   │   ├── eth-account-keyfile
│   │   └── keep-client-config.toml
│   ├── eth-account-password.txt
│   ├── keep-client-quickstart.adoc
│   └── keep-client-snapshot.tar
└── keep-client-deployment-bundle.tar.gz
```

=== Load the Docker image

```
cd keep-client-deployment-bundle
docker load -i keep-client-snapshot.tar
```

Resulting image should be listed in `docker image ls` as:

`gcr.io/keep-test-f3e0/keep-client:latest`

=== Run the container

Run this from the `keep-client-deployment-bundle` directory:

```
export KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=$(cat eth-account-password.txt)
export KEEP_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR=$(pwd)/config
export KEEP_CLIENT_PERSISTENCE_DIR=$(pwd)/persistence

docker run -dit \
--volume $KEEP_CLIENT_PERSISTENCE_DIR:/mnt/keep-client/persistence \
--volume $KEEP_CLIENT_CONFIG_DIR:/mnt/keep-client/config \
--env KEEP_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD=$KEEP_CLIENT_ETHEREUM_PASSWORD \
--env LOG_LEVEL=debug \
-p 3919:3919 \
gcr.io/keep-test-f3e0/keep-client --config /mnt/keep-client/config/keep-client-config.toml start
```

=== Check logs for startup

`docker ps | grep keep-client | awk '{print $1}' | xargs docker logs -f`

Startup log should look like:
```
Established connection with bootstrap peer [xxxxxx]

| IPs : /ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/3919/ipfs/xxxxxx                                                 |

```

== Commands
