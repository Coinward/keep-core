= Random Beacon Signing

== Terminology

`P1`:: The generator point for the BLS elliptic curve

`X_k`:: The group private key of `Group_k`

`Y_k`:: The group public key: `Y_k = P1 * X_k`

`Entry_e`:: The entry matching the entry identifier `e`

`Input_e`:: The input for generating the new entry:
`Entry_e = Input_e * X`

`x_i`:: The individual private key of `P_i`

`y_i`:: The individual public key of `P_i`: `y_i = P1 * x_i`

`Share_i`:: The signature share by `P_i`: `Share_i = Input_e * x_i`

`N`:: The number of members in a group

`H`:: The number of members required for a honest majority

== Signing group selection

When a valid request has been received,
the beacon begins the relay entry generation.

The current block is recorded as the start block of the entry generation:

`currentEntryStartBlock = block.number`

The previous entry is hashed to produce the signing group selection seed.

`seed = keccak256(previousEntry)`

The signing group is selected by taking the value of the seed
modulo the number of currently active groups,
and selecting the corresponding active group:

`selectedGroup = seed % numberOfGroups()`

== Signature generation

The selected group now has `relayEntryTimeout` blocks to submit the
signature to `previousEntry`.

=== Generating signature shares

Each member `P_i` in `selectedGroup` calculates
their signature share:
`Share_i = previousEntry * x_i`.

The generated shares are broadcast to the other members.
The broadcast message contains
the `Share_i` and the member index `i` of the sender `P_i`.

`Message = (Share_i, i)`

=== Verifying signature shares

When `P_i` receives a signature share `Share_j` broadcast by `P_j`,
the share can be verified by `blsVerify(Share_j, y_j, previousEntry)`.
If `Share_j` is valid,
`P_i` can use it for reconstructing the threshold signature.
If `Share_j` is invalid, `P_i` must not use it for reconstructing the entry.

=== Reconstructing the signature

Once `P_i` has received at least `blsThreshold` valid shares,
the entry can be reconstructed using Lagrange interpolation.

----
shares = validMessages.map(share)

indices = validMessages.map(index)

newEntry = lagrangeInterpolate(0, indices, shares)
----

== Output submission

Member _P~submitter~_ of _Group~i~_ submits
`newEntry = blsSign(previousEntry, X_i)`

The beacon verifies that the submitted entry
is a valid signature of the previous entry
for the selected group's public key:

`blsVerify(newEntry, previousEntry, Y_i)`

If the submitted entry is valid,
it is accepted as the current beacon entry _Entry~i~ = newEntry_.
Reward _P~submitter~_ and other members of _Group~i~_
according to the reward formula.

If the submitted entry is invalid, it is rejected.

== Entry timeout

If a valid output is not submitted before block
`timeoutBlock = currentEntryStartBlock + relayEntryTimeout + 1`,
the entry generation for the selected group times out.
From `timeoutBlock` onwards,
no submissions by _Group~i~_ are accepted,
and anyone can report the timeout by calling `reportRelayEntryTimeout()`.

When the beacon receives a valid timeout report
the previously selected group is terminated,
with each member penalized for their (lack of) contribution to the failure.
The beacon returns to the signing group selection
with the failed group being removed from the group pool.
